Learnist is a tool to help people learn new things more effectively by tracking their progress on a daily basis.

Learnist lives in (beta)production here: https://murmuring-river-4737.herokuapp.com/

Please feel free to use, fork, or clone the app, as well as to send me feature requests. I'll do my best to work them into 
the next version.
